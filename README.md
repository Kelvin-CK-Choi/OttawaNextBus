# OttawaNextBus

OttawaNextBus is an original project that I have created to demonstrate the Java concepts that I have learned at Algonquin College and through self-study. This application retrieves real-time information from OC Transpo and presents it in an organized and user-friendly manner. Users can customize their experience by setting their default stop and route or by adding them to their list of favorites.

The project showcases my intermediate level understanding of various Java concepts, such as Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, inheritance, exception handling, collections, JSON parsing and more. It serves as evidence of my proficiency in these areas and demonstrates my ability to apply my knowledge to create practical and useful applications.

In addition, this application will serve as the foundation for an Android app that I plan to develop after this semester, when I will gain the necessary knowledge and skills to write mobile applications.
